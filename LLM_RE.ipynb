Our method signiﬁcantly outper-\\nforms the state-of-the-art on six text clas-\\nsiﬁcation tasks, reducing the error by 18-\\n24% on the majority of datasets. Further-\\nmore, with only 100labeled examples, it\\nmatches the performance of training from\\nscratch on 100×more data. We open-\\nsource our pretrained models and code1.\\n1 Introduction\\nInductive transfer learning has had a large impact\\non computer vision (CV). Applied CV models (in-\\ncluding object detection, classiﬁcation, and seg-\\nmentation) are rarely trained from scratch, but in-\\nstead are ﬁne-tuned from models that have been\\npretrained on ImageNet, MS-COCO, and other\\ndatasets (Sharif Razavian et al., 2014; Long et al.,\\n2015a; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017).\\nText classiﬁcation is a category of Natural Lan-\\nguage Processing (NLP) tasks with real-world ap-\\nplications such as spam, fraud, and bot detection\\n(Jindal and Liu, 2007; Ngai et al., 2011; Chu et al.,\\n2012), emergency response (Caragea et al., 2011),\\nand commercial document classiﬁcation, such as\\nfor legal discovery (Roitblat et al., 2010).\\n1http://nlp.fast.ai/ulmfit .\\n⋆Equal contribution. Jeremy focused on the algorithm de-\\nvelopment and implementation, Sebastian focused on the ex-\\nperiments and writing.While Deep Learning models have achieved\\nstate-of-the-art on many NLP tasks, these models\\nare trained from scratch, requiring large datasets,\\nand days to converge. Research in NLP focused\\nmostly on transductive transfer (Blitzer et al.,\\n2007). For inductive transfer, ﬁne-tuning pre-\\ntrained word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013),\\na simple transfer technique that only targets a\\nmodel’s ﬁrst layer, has had a large impact in prac-\\ntice and is used in most state-of-the-art models.\\nRecent approaches that concatenate embeddings\\nderived from other tasks with the input at different\\nlayers (Peters et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2017;\\nPeters et al., 2018) still train the main task model\\nfrom scratch and treat pretrained embeddings as\\nﬁxed parameters, limiting their usefulness.\\nIn light of the beneﬁts of pretraining (Erhan\\net al., 2010), we should be able to do better than\\nrandomly initializing the remaining parameters of\\nour models. However, inductive transfer via ﬁne-\\ntuning has been unsuccessful for NLP (Mou et al.,\\n2016).

For this\\nreason, most work in CV focuses on transferring\\nthe ﬁrst layers of the model (Long et al., 2015b).\\nSharif Razavian et al. (2014) achieve state-of-the-\\nart results using features of an ImageNet model as\\ninput to a simple classiﬁer. In recent years, this\\napproach has been superseded by ﬁne-tuning ei-\\nther the last (Donahue et al., 2014) or several of\\nthe last layers of a pretrained model and leaving\\nthe remaining layers frozen (Long et al., 2015a).\\nHypercolumns In NLP, only recently have\\nmethods been proposed that go beyond transfer-\\nring word embeddings. The prevailing approach\\nis to pretrain embeddings that capture additional\\ncontext via other tasks. Embeddings at different\\nlevels are then used as features, concatenated ei-\\nther with the word embeddings or with the in-\\nputs at intermediate layers.

(2017) who use\\nlanguage modeling, paraphrasing, entailment, and\\nMachine Translation (MT) respectively for pre-\\ntraining. Speciﬁcally, Peters et al. (2018) require\\nengineered custom architectures, while we show\\nstate-of-the-art performance with the same basic\\narchitecture across a range of tasks. In CV , hyper-\\ncolumns have been nearly entirely superseded by\\nend-to-end ﬁne-tuning (Long et al., 2015a).\\nMulti-task learning A related direction is\\nmulti-task learning (MTL) (Caruana, 1993). This\\nis the approach taken by Rei (2017) and Liu et al.\\n(2018) who add a language modeling objective\\nto the model that is trained jointly with the main\\ntask model. MTL requires the tasks to be trained\\nfrom scratch every time, which makes it inefﬁcient\\nand often requires careful weighting of the task-\\nspeciﬁc objective functions (Chen et al., 2017).\\nFine-tuning Fine-tuning has been used success-\\nfully to transfer between similar tasks, e.g. in QA\\n(Min et al., 2017), for distantly supervised senti-\\nment analysis (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015), or\\nMT domains (Sennrich et al., 2015) but has been\\nshown to fail between unrelated ones (Mou et al.,\\n2016). Dai and Le (2015) also ﬁne-tune a lan-\\nguage model, but overﬁt with 10k labeled exam-\\nples and require millions of in-domain documents\\nfor good performance. In contrast, ULMFiT lever-\\nages general-domain pretraining and novel ﬁne-\\ntuning techniques to prevent overﬁtting even with\\nonly100labeled examples and achieves state-of-\\nthe-art results also on small datasets.\\n3 Universal Language Model Fine-tuning\\nWe are interested in the most general inductive\\ntransfer learning setting for NLP (Pan and Yang,\\n2010): Given a static source task TSandanytar-\\nget taskTTwithTS̸=TT, we would like to im-\\nprove performance on TT. Language modeling\\ncan be seen as the ideal source task and a counter-\\npart of ImageNet for NLP: It captures many facets\\nof language relevant for downstream tasks, such as\\nlong-term dependencies (Linzen et al., 2016), hi-\\nerarchical relations (Gulordava et al., 2018), and\\nsentiment (Radford et al., 2017). In contrast to\\ntasks like MT (McCann et al., 2017) and entail-\\nment (Conneau et al., 2017), it provides data in\\nnear-unlimited quantities for most domains and\\nlanguages.

Moreover, language\\nmodeling already is a key component of existing\\ntasks such as MT and dialogue modeling. For-\\nmally, language modeling induces a hypothesis\\nspaceHthat should be useful for many other NLP\\ntasks (Vapnik and Kotz, 1982; Baxter, 2000).\\nWe propose Universal Language Model Fine-\\ntuning (ULMFiT), which pretrains a language\\nmodel (LM) on a large general-domain corpus and\\nﬁne-tunes it on the target task using novel tech-\\nniques. The method is universal in the sense that\\nit meets these practical criteria: 1) It works across\\ntasks varying in document size, number, and label\\ntype; 2) it uses a single architecture and training\\nprocess; 3) it requires no custom feature engineer-\\ning or preprocessing; and 4) it does not require ad-\\nditional in-domain documents or labels.\\nIn our experiments, we use the state-of-the-\\nart language model AWD-LSTM (Merity et al.,\\n2017a), a regular LSTM (with no attention,\\nshort-cut connections, or other sophisticated ad-\\nditions) with various tuned dropout hyperparame-\\nters. Analogous to CV , we expect that downstream\\nperformance can be improved by using higher-\\nperformance language models in the future.\\nULMFiT consists of the following steps, which\\nwe show in Figure 1: a) General-domain LM\\npretraining (§3.1); b) target task LM ﬁne-tuning\\n(§3.2); and c) target task classiﬁer ﬁne-tuning\\n(§3.3). We discuss these in the following sections.3.1 General-domain LM pretraining\\nAn ImageNet-like corpus for language should be\\nlarge and capture general properties of language.\\nWe pretrain the language model on Wikitext-103\\n(Merity et al., 2017b) consisting of 28,595 prepro-\\ncessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words.\\nPretraining is most beneﬁcial for tasks with small\\ndatasets and enables generalization even with 100\\nlabeled examples. We leave the exploration of\\nmore diverse pretraining corpora to future work,\\nbut expect that they would boost performance.\\nWhile this stage is the most expensive, it only\\nneeds to be performed once and improves perfor-\\nmance and convergence of downstream models.\\n3.2 Target task LM ﬁne-tuning\\nNo matter how diverse the general-domain data\\nused for pretraining is, the data of the target task\\nwill likely come from a different distribution. We\\nthus ﬁne-tune the LM on data of the target task.\\nGiven a pretrained general-domain LM, this stage\\nconverges faster as it only needs to adapt to the id-\\niosyncrasies of the target data, and it allows us to\\ntrain a robust LM even for small datasets. We pro-\\npose discriminative ﬁne-tuning andslanted trian-\\ngular learning rates for ﬁne-tuning the LM, which\\nwe introduce in the following.\\nDiscriminative ﬁne-tuning As different layers\\ncapture different types of information (Yosinski\\net al., 2014), they should be ﬁne-tuned to differ-\\nent extents . To this end, we propose a novel ﬁne-tuning method, discriminative ﬁne-tuning3.\\nInstead of using the same learning rate for all\\nlayers of the model, discriminative ﬁne-tuning al-\\nlows us to tune each layer with different learning\\nrates. For context, the regular stochastic gradient\\ndescent (SGD) update of a model’s parameters θat\\ntime steptlooks like the following (Ruder, 2016):\\nθt=θt−1−η·∇θJ(θ) (1)\\nwhereηis the learning rate and ∇θJ(θ)is the gra-\\ndient with regard to the model’s objective func-\\ntion. For discriminative ﬁne-tuning, we split the\\nparametersθinto{θ1,...,θL}whereθlcontains\\nthe parameters of the model at the l-th layer and\\nLis the number of layers of the model. Similarly,\\nwe obtain{η1,...,ηL}whereηlis the learning\\nrate of thel-th layer.\\nThe SGD update with discriminative ﬁne-\\ntuning is then the following:\\nθl\\nt=θl\\nt−1−ηl·∇θlJ(θ) (2)\\nWe empirically found it to work well to ﬁrst\\nchoose the learning rate ηLof the last layer by\\nﬁne-tuning only the last layer and using ηl−1=\\nηl/2.6as the learning rate for lower layers.\\nSlanted triangular learning rates For adapting\\nits parameters to task-speciﬁc features, we would\\nlike the model to quickly converge to a suitable\\nregion of the parameter space in the beginning\\nof training and then reﬁne its parameters. Using\\nthe same learning rate (LR) or an annealed learn-\\ning rate throughout training is not the best way\\nto achieve this behaviour. Instead, we propose\\nslanted triangular learning rates (STLR), which\\nﬁrst linearly increases the learning rate and then\\nlinearly decays it according to the following up-\\ndate schedule, which can be seen in Figure 2:\\ncut=⌊T·cutfrac⌋\\np={\\nt/cut, ift<cut\\n1−t−cut\\ncut·(1/cutfrac−1),otherwise\\nηt=ηmax·1 +p·(ratio−1)\\nratio(3)\\nwhereTis the number of training iterations4,\\ncutfrac is the fraction of iterations we increase\\n3An unrelated method of the same name exists for deep\\nBoltzmann machines (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009).\\n4In other words, the number of epochs times the number\\nof updates per epoch.the LR,cutis the iteration when we switch from\\nincreasing to decreasing the LR, pis the fraction of\\nthe number of iterations we have increased or will\\ndecrease the LR respectively, ratio speciﬁes how\\nmuch smaller the lowest LR is from the maximum\\nLRηmax, andηtis the learning rate at iteration t.\\nWe generally use cutfrac = 0.1,ratio = 32 and\\nηmax= 0.01.\\nSTLR modiﬁes triangular learning rates (Smith,\\n2017) with a short increase and a long decay pe-\\nriod, which we found key for good performance.5\\nIn Section 5, we compare against aggressive co-\\nsine annealing, a similar schedule that has recently\\nbeen used to achieve state-of-the-art performance\\nin CV (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017).6\\nFigure 2: The slanted triangular learning rate\\nschedule used for ULMFiT as a function of the\\nnumber of training iterations.\\n3.3 Target task classiﬁer ﬁne-tuning\\nFinally, for ﬁne-tuning the classiﬁer, we augment\\nthe pretrained language model with two additional\\nlinear blocks. Following standard practice for\\nCV classiﬁers, each block uses batch normaliza-\\ntion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and dropout, with\\nReLU activations for the intermediate layer and a\\nsoftmax activation that outputs a probability dis-\\ntribution over target classes at the last layer. Note\\nthat the parameters in these task-speciﬁc classi-\\nﬁer layers are the only ones that are learned from\\nscratch. The ﬁrst linear layer takes as the input the\\npooled last hidden layer states.\\nConcat pooling The signal in text classiﬁcation\\ntasks is often contained in a few words, which may\\n5We also credit personal communication with the author.\\n6While Loshchilov and Hutter (2017) use multiple anneal-\\ning cycles, we generally found one cycle to work best.occur anywhere in the document. As input docu-\\nments can consist of hundreds of words, informa-\\ntion may get lost if we only consider the last hid-\\nden state of the model. For this reason, we con-\\ncatenate the hidden state at the last time step hT\\nof the document with both the max-pooled and the\\nmean-pooled representation of the hidden states\\nover as many time steps as ﬁt in GPU memory\\nH={h1,...,hT}:\\nhc= [hT,maxpool (H),meanpool (H)] (4)\\nwhere []is concatenation.\\nFine-tuning the target classiﬁer is the most crit-\\nical part of the transfer learning method. Overly\\naggressive ﬁne-tuning will cause catastrophic for-\\ngetting, eliminating the beneﬁt of the information\\ncaptured through language modeling; too cautious\\nﬁne-tuning will lead to slow convergence (and re-\\nsultant overﬁtting). Besides discriminative ﬁne-\\ntuning and triangular learning rates, we propose\\ngradual unfreezing for ﬁne-tuning the classiﬁer.\\nGradual unfreezing Rather than ﬁne-tuning all\\nlayers at once, which risks catastrophic forgetting,\\nwe propose to gradually unfreeze the model start-\\ning from the last layer as this contains the least\\ngeneral knowledge (Yosinski et al., 2014): We\\nﬁrst unfreeze the last layer and ﬁne-tune all un-\\nfrozen layers for one epoch. We then unfreeze the\\nnext lower frozen layer and repeat, until we ﬁne-\\ntune all layers until convergence at the last itera-\\ntion. This is similar to ‘ chain-thaw ’ (Felbo et al.,\\n2017), except that we add a layer at a time to the\\nset of ‘thawed’ layers, rather than only training a\\nsingle layer at a time.\\nWhile discriminative ﬁne-tuning, slanted trian-\\ngular learning rates, and gradual unfreezing all\\nare beneﬁcial on their own, we show in Section\\n5 that they complement each other and enable our\\nmethod to perform well across diverse datasets.\\nBPTT for Text Classiﬁcation (BPT3C) Lan-\\nguage models are trained with backpropagation\\nthrough time (BPTT) to enable gradient propa-\\ngation for large input sequences. In order to\\nmake ﬁne-tuning a classiﬁer for large documents\\nfeasible, we propose BPTT for Text Classiﬁca-\\ntion (BPT3C): We divide the document into ﬁxed-\\nlength batches of size b.

For all our experiments, we pretrain both a\\nforward and a backward LM. We ﬁne-tune a clas-\\nsiﬁer for each LM independently using BPT3C\\nand average the classiﬁer predictions.\\n4 Experiments\\nWhile our approach is equally applicable to se-\\nquence labeling tasks, we focus on text classiﬁca-\\ntion tasks in this work due to their important real-\\nworld applications.\\n4.1 Experimental setup\\nDatasets and tasks We evaluate our method on\\nsix widely-studied datasets, with varying numbers\\nof documents and varying document length, used\\nby state-of-the-art text classiﬁcation and transfer\\nlearning approaches (Johnson and Zhang, 2017;\\nMcCann et al., 2017) as instances of three com-\\nmon text classiﬁcation tasks: sentiment analy-\\nsis, question classiﬁcation, and topic classiﬁca-\\ntion.

In addition, to allow the lan-\\nguage model to capture aspects that might be rel-\\nevant for classiﬁcation, we add special tokens for\\nupper-case words, elongation, and repetition.\\nHyperparameters We are interested in a model\\nthat performs robustly across a diverse set of tasks.\\nTo this end, if not mentioned otherwise, we use the\\nsame set of hyperparameters across tasks, which\\nwe tune on the IMDb validation set. We use\\nthe AWD-LSTM language model (Merity et al.,\\n2017a) with an embedding size of 400,3layers,\\n1150 hidden activations per layer, and a BPTT\\nbatch size of 70. We apply dropout of 0.4to\\nlayers, 0.3to RNN layers, 0.4to input embed-\\nding layers, 0.05to embedding layers, and weight\\ndropout of 0.5to the RNN hidden-to-hidden ma-\\ntrix.

This is promising as the existing state-\\nof-the-art requires complex architectures (Peters\\net al., 2018), multiple forms of attention (McCann\\net al., 2017) and sophisticated embedding schemes\\n(Johnson and Zhang, 2016), while our method em-\\nploys a regular LSTM with dropout.

We use a\\nlearning rate ηL= 0.01for ‘Discr ’, learning rates\\n8To avoid overﬁtting, we only train the vanilla LM classi-\\nﬁer for 5epochs and keep dropout of 0.4in the classiﬁer.Classiﬁer ﬁne-tuning IMDb TREC-6 AG\\nFrom scratch 9.93 13.36 6.81\\nFull 6.87 6.86 5.81\\nFull + discr 5.57 6.21 5.62\\nLast 6.49 16.09 8.38\\nChain-thaw 5.39 6.71 5.90\\nFreez 6.37 6.86 5.81\\nFreez + discr 5.39 5.86 6.04\\nFreez + stlr 5.04 6.02 5.35\\nFreez + cos 5.70 6.38 5.29\\nFreez + discr + stlr 5.00 5.69 5.38\\nTable 7: Validation error rates for ULMFiT with\\ndifferent methods to ﬁne-tune the classiﬁer.\\nof0.001and0.0001 for the last and all other layers\\nrespectively for ‘ Chain-thaw ’ as in (Felbo et al.,\\n2017), and a learning rate of 0.001otherwise. We\\nshow the results in Table 7.\\nFine-tuning the classiﬁer signiﬁcantly improves\\nover training from scratch, particularly on the\\nsmall TREC-6. ‘ Last’, the standard ﬁne-tuning\\nmethod in CV , severely underﬁts and is never\\nable to lower the training error to 0. ‘Chain-\\nthaw ’ achieves competitive performance on the\\nsmaller datasets, but is outperformed signiﬁcantly\\non the large AG. ‘ Freez ’ provides similar per-\\nformance as ‘ Full’. ‘Discr ’ consistently boosts\\nthe performance of ‘ Full’ and ‘ Freez ’, except\\nfor the large AG. Cosine annealing is competi-\\ntive with slanted triangular learning rates on large\\ndata, but under-performs on smaller datasets. Fi-\\nnally, full ULMFiT classiﬁer ﬁne-tuning (bottom\\nrow) achieves the best performance on IMDB and\\nTREC-6 and competitive performance on AG. Im-\\nportantly, ULMFiT is the only method that shows\\nexcellent performance across the board—and is\\ntherefore the only universal method.\\nClassiﬁer ﬁne-tuning behavior While our re-\\nsults demonstrate that how we ﬁne-tune the clas-\\nsiﬁer makes a signiﬁcant difference, ﬁne-tuning\\nfor inductive transfer is currently under-explored\\nin NLP as it mostly has been thought to be un-\\nhelpful (Mou et al., 2016). To better understand\\nthe ﬁne-tuning behavior of our model, we compare\\nthe validation error of the classiﬁer ﬁne-tuned with\\nULMFiT and ‘ Full’ during training in Figure 4.\\nOn all datasets, ﬁne-tuning the full model leads\\nto the lowest error comparatively early in train-\\ning, e.g. already after the ﬁrst epoch on IMDb.Figure 4: Validation error rate curves for ﬁne-\\ntuning the classiﬁer with ULMFiT and ‘ Full’ on\\nIMDb, TREC-6, and AG (top to bottom).\\nThe error then increases as the model starts to\\noverﬁt and knowledge captured through pretrain-\\ning is lost. In contrast, ULMFiT is more sta-\\nble and suffers from no such catastrophic forget-\\nting; performance remains similar or improves un-\\ntil late epochs, which shows the positive effect of\\nthe learning rate schedule.\\nImpact of bidirectionality At the cost of train-\\ning a second model, ensembling the predictions of\\na forward and backwards LM-classiﬁer brings a\\nperformance boost of around 0.5–0.7. On IMDb\\nwe lower the test error from 5.30of a single model\\nto4.58for the bidirectional model.\\n6 Discussion and future directions\\nWhile we have shown that ULMFiT can achieve\\nstate-of-the-art performance on widely used text\\nclassiﬁcation tasks, we believe that language\\nmodel ﬁne-tuning will be particularly useful in the\\nfollowing settings compared to existing transfer\\nlearning approaches (Conneau et al., 2017; Mc-\\nCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018): a) NLP for\\nnon-English languages, where training data for su-\\npervised pretraining tasks is scarce; b) new NLP\\ntasks where no state-of-the-art architecture exists;\\nand c) tasks with limited amounts of labeled data\\n(and some amounts of unlabeled data).Given that transfer learning and particularly\\nﬁne-tuning for NLP is under-explored, many fu-\\nture directions are possible. One possible direc-\\ntion is to improve language model pretraining and\\nﬁne-tuning and make them more scalable: for\\nImageNet, predicting far fewer classes only in-\\ncurs a small performance drop (Huh et al., 2016),\\nwhile recent work shows that an alignment be-\\ntween source and target task label sets is impor-\\ntant (Mahajan et al., 2018)—focusing on predict-\\ning a subset of words such as the most frequent\\nones might retain most of the performance while\\nspeeding up training. Language modeling can also\\nbe augmented with additional tasks in a multi-task\\nlearning fashion (Caruana, 1993) or enriched with\\nadditional supervision, e.g. syntax-sensitive de-\\npendencies (Linzen et al., 2016) to create a model\\nthat is more general or better suited for certain\\ndownstream tasks, ideally in a weakly-supervised\\nmanner to retain its universal properties.\\nAnother direction is to apply the method to\\nnovel tasks and models. While an extension to\\nsequence labeling is straightforward, other tasks\\nwith more complex interactions such as entailment\\nor question answering may require novel ways to\\npretrain and ﬁne-tune. Finally, while we have\\nprovided a series of analyses and ablations, more\\nstudies are required to better understand what\\nknowledge a pretrained language model captures,\\nhow this changes during ﬁne-tuning, and what in-\\nformation different tasks require.\\n7 Conclusion\\nWe have proposed ULMFiT, an effective and ex-\\ntremely sample-efﬁcient transfer learning method\\nthat can be applied to any NLP task. We have also\\nproposed several novel ﬁne-tuning techniques that\\nin conjunction prevent catastrophic forgetting and\\nenable robust learning across a diverse range of\\ntasks. Our method signiﬁcantly outperformed ex-\\nisting transfer learning techniques and the state-\\nof-the-art on six representative text classiﬁcation\\ntasks. We hope that our results will catalyze new\\ndevelopments in transfer learning for NLP.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their valu-\\nable feedback.
